# Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. The most common unsupervised learning method is cluster analysis, which is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data.

<h2>Supervised vs Unsupervised</h2>

In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.

# Clustering

Grouping of similar data items together is known as clustering. This is mainly
used for summarization of data.

<h3><li>Cluster analysis</li></h3>

The process of grouping data basing on the information found is known as
cluster analysis. The main goal of cluster analysis is that the objects within a
group be similar to one another and different from the objects in other groups.

# K-Means Clustering

k- Means defines a prototype in terms of a centroid, which is usually the mean
of a group of points and is applied to objects in a continuous n-dimensional data.

# Hierarchical Clustering

In this type of clustering, the set of clusters are nested clusters that are
organized in the form of a tree known as dendrogram. Each node in the tree
is the union of its children and root of the tree is the cluster containing all the
objects.

There are two types of hierarchical clustering. They are:

<ul>
  <li>Agglomerative hierarchical clustering</li>
  <li>Divisive hierarchical clustering</li>
</ul>
